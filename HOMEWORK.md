# Homework 5 - Object Transformation without Mutation

## Due Date

Tuesday, September 10, 2019

## Goals

- The purpose of this homework is to learn about instance method chaining without
  mutating the original object. For example, if we were in `irb`, one can do
  the following:

  ```text
  person = Person.new('giovanni')
  puts person # => "giovanni"
  person.titlelize.upcase.reverse.undo # =>"GIOVANNI"
  ```

## Design Goals

- Your class can be no longer than 100 lines of code.
- Your methods can be no longer than five lines of code.
- You can pass no more than four parameters and you can’t just make it one big hash.
- Your methods should perform a single responsibility.

## Test Driving The Person class

- change directory to the project directory

  ```bash
  unzip fh-homework-05.zip
  cd /path/to/fh-homework-05
  rm -rf .git
  bundle install
  ```

- implement the following `Person` class methods:

  - to_s - returns to the string representation of our person instance

  - titlelize - converts the first character of the first_name to uppercase

  - upcase - converts all the characters of the first_name to upper case

  - downcase - converst all the characters of the first_name to lower case

  - reverse - reverses the characters of the first_name

  - hyphenize - adds a hyphenize between each character of the first_name

  - undo - reverses the most recent transformation

  Note: transformations should not modify the state of the original Person
  instance. Thus, I would recommend coming up with a data structure
  for maintaining the history of the transformations.

- executing the tests

  - running all the tests

    ```bash
    cd /path/to/fh-homework-05-MM.DD.YYYY
    bundle exec rspec
    ```

  - running a specific test

    ```bash
    bundle exec rspec ./spec/person_spec.rb:4 # Person #new
    bundle exec rspec ./spec/person_spec.rb:10 # Person #to_s
    bundle exec rspec ./spec/person_spec.rb:18 # Person #titlelize
    bundle exec rspec ./spec/person_spec.rb:26 # Person #upcase
    bundle exec rspec ./spec/person_spec.rb:34 # Person #downcase
    bundle exec rspec ./spec/person_spec.rb:42 # Person #reverse
    bundle exec rspec ./spec/person_spec.rb:50 # Person #hyphenize
    bundle exec rspec ./spec/person_spec.rb:58 # Person #undo
    ```

    Note: You will not need the comment at the end of the line when
    executing a specific test. For example,

    ```bash
    bundle exec rspec ./spec/person_spec.rb:4
    ```

## Deliverables

- Please create a repo called `fh-homework-05` on Github.com and push your
  finished work there.
